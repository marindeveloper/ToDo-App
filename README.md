# **Simple To-Do App**

A simple, drag-and-drop task management app inspired by Trello. Organize your tasks into groups (To Do, In Progress, Done) and customize the app's appearance with a color picker.


## **Features**

- **Task Groups**: Organize tasks into three groups: To Do, In Progress, and Done.
- **Drag-and-Drop**: You can move tasks between groups by dragging and dropping.
- **Customizable Colors**: Personalize the appearance by changing button colors with the built-in color picker.
- **Local Storage**: Tasks are stored locally in your browser, ensuring they're still there even after refreshing the page. Please note, clearing browser chache might reset your preferences and tasks. Your browser can also delete chache after a while, so be careful!


## **How to Use**

1. **Add a Task**  
   Type a task in the input box under any group and click "Add."

2. **Move a Task**  
   Drag and drop tasks between groups (To Do, In Progress, Done).

3. **Delete a Task**  
   Click the **X** button next to a task to delete it.

4. **Customize Colors**  
   Click the gear icon (⚙️) to open the color picker and choose your preferred button color.
